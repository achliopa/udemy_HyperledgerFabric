# Course 1 - Blockchain Development on Hyperledger Fabric using Composer

## Section 1 - Introduction

### Lecture 3 - What is Hyperleder?

* Hyperledger is an umbrella  project of various tools and frameworks that have to do with business blockchains. it is an Incubator of BC Technologies
* More details on the edX course notes
* Hyperledger DLT (Distributed Ledger Technologies) Frameworks
	* Hyperledger Sawtooth (intel)
	* Hyperledger Iroha (soramitsu)
	* Hyperledger Fabric (IBM)
	* Hyperledger Burrow (Monacs)
* Hyperldeger Tools
	* Hyperledger Cello
	* Hyperledger Composer
	* hyperldeger Explorer
	* hyperledger Quilt
* This course focuses on Fabric and Composer
* We can [Join](https://www.hyperledger.org/community) Hyperledger Community
* 159 engs of 28 companies work on hyperledger fabric
* it reached 1.0 on july 2017
* Hyperledger Fabric: Productionb ready BC Framework for Business Blockchain applications
* It offers:
	* A set of infrasturcture & application building blocks
	* Practices & Guidelines for crating BC apps
* Hyperledger COmposer is a Tools for creating business applications on Hyperledger DLT Frameworks

### Lecture 4 - Distributed Ledger Technology & its Challenges

* Fabric allows the creation of a decentralized systme for the exchange of value
* In hyperledger an Asset represents value (tangible or not)
* all asset exchange transactions are recorded in a distributed ledger. each participant has its copy
* an example is recording car parts source
* some industries need a complete record of all asset components back to the source. aircraft manuf industry anbd food industry (track faulty part source or contaminated food source)
* In DLT each entity involved in exchange of value keeps a replica of the ledger
* DLTs face some challenges:
	* maintain consistency
	* privacy (participants not visible to public but may decide to disclose idenity)
	* confidentiality (information exchanged by the parties is visible only to authorized parties)
	* standarization
	* interoperability
	* scalability
* Fabric addresses most of the challenges
